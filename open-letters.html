                </div>
                
                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>I (BK) remember the moment I realized I had no language for what was wrong. I was successful by every conventional measure - leading innovation teams, building strategies, getting recognition. But sitting in another meeting about quarterly objectives, I felt this disconnect that had no name in the corporate vocabulary available to me.</p>

                    <p>It wasn't burnout, though I was tired. It wasn't that my work lacked impact - we were solving real problems. Something more fundamental was missing, and it took me years to understand: we'd reduced everything to "Work" with a capital W.</p>

                    <p>Work as commodity. Work as the thing you do from 9-5 to earn money, separate from who you are and what you care about. Work measured by productivity metrics, defined by job descriptions, organized into careers. Work that extracts value from people and planet in service to efficiency and competition.</p>

                    <p>But there's another kind of work that's almost completely disappeared from how we talk and think. When my Quechua teacher described <em>llankay</em>, she wasn't translating "work" - she was describing one of three fundamental principles that can't exist separately. <em>Llankay</em> (work), <em>munay</em> (love), and <em>yachay</em> (wisdom) form a unity. You can't have one without the others.</p>

                    <p>This is work as tending. Caring for children is work. Growing food is work. Healing relationships is work. Creating beauty is work. Solving problems together is work. Maintaining community is work. And it's all done with reverence for Pachamama - not as metaphor, but as recognition that we're part of living systems, not separate from them.</p>

                    <div class="quote-box">
                        <p>"In nature's economy the currency is not money, it is life."</p>
                        <p class="quote-author">- Vandana Shiva</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>In Andean cosmovision, all work is <em>ayni</em> - reciprocity that maintains cosmic balance. Not cosmic in some abstract sense, but cosmic as in: you work with the earth, with ancestors, with community. You're not just manipulating resources. Work follows natural rhythms. It serves the whole. And here's what struck me most: the work nourishes the worker as much as it produces results.</p>

                    <p>Contrast this with how most of us actually spend our days. We've accepted a strange severance - that work must be separated from meaning, from relationship, from our actual lives. That this separation is just "how it is" for adults. That maybe on weekends or after retirement we can tend to what matters.</p>

                    <h3>The Three Meanings of "Present"</h3>

                    <p>When CX and I started talking about "the present of work," people kept asking what we meant. It took us a while to realize we meant all three definitions at once - and that western industrial thinking has systematically separated them:</p>

                    <p><strong>Present as Presence.</strong> I notice in myself how rare it is to be fully here with what I'm doing. My attention is usually split - thinking about the next meeting while in this one, planning tomorrow while supposedly listening today. But there are moments when I'm completely engaged with what's in front of me, bringing my whole self rather than just the professional persona. That's when work as tending becomes possible. That's when I'm actually in relationship with what I'm doing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Present as Present Moment.</strong> Most work operates on anxiety about the future or regret about the past. But what if action could arise from clear seeing of what's needed right now? Not ignoring consequences, but not being driven primarily by fear of what might happen or attachment to specific outcomes. This is harder than it sounds. I still catch myself trying to control results rather than responding to what's actually here.</p>

                    <p><strong>Present as Gift.</strong> This one keeps challenging me. What if the work I offer could strengthen rather than deplete the web of relationships I'm part of? Not work as transaction where I give labor for money, but work as offering that enriches both giver and receiver, that keeps moving through community creating abundance rather than extraction?</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>A Gift is Not a Gift Until It Moves</h4>
                        <p>In gift economies, the act of giving creates and maintains relationships rather than ending them. The gift keeps circulating, weaving stronger bonds throughout the web of life. When we offer our actual gifts - skills, attention, care, creativity - we're not depleting ourselves but participating in the circulation of life force that nourishes everyone. At least, that's the theory. We're still figuring out how this works in practice when rent is due.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I don't have this figured out. None of us do. We're trying to remember something that's been systematically erased from how we organize human activity, while still living in systems that demand we produce and earn and measure and compete. It's messy work, this remembering. But it feels more honest than pretending the severance is natural, that this is just how work is.</p>

                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>Dear Fellow Leaders,</p>

                    <p>I (BK) want to tell you about a failure that taught me more than any success.</p>

                    <p>Years ago, I was leading what felt like important work inside a large corporation. We'd built this incredible team of volunteers - 25-30 people who believed something different was possible. We stayed up nights sketching strategies, being methodical and scientific about our approach. We were smart about it. We built momentum.</p>

                    <p>I remember the Tuesday afternoon when I realized it was over. Not in a dramatic moment, but in a meeting where I watched someone with institutional power gently redirect our initiative into something that looked similar but served completely different purposes. By the time I understood what had happened, our most visionary people had been quietly reassigned. The language we'd developed had been co-opted. And I'd been moved to a "special projects" role that everyone knew meant something else.</p>

                    <p>What I missed: we'd focused intensely on the mechanics of change while neglecting the relational field that could hold emergence. We'd worked on strategy while forgetting that brilliant strategies mean nothing if the relationships aren't there to hold them when systems push back. And systems always push back.</p>

                    <div class="quote-box">
                        <p>"The success of an intervention depends on the interior condition of the intervenor."</p>
                        <p class="quote-author">- Otto Scharmer</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>You've probably invested in transformation initiatives. Maybe you've hired consultants who brought frameworks and methodologies. Maybe you've sent teams to retreats where everyone felt inspired, only to watch the energy dissipate when they returned to daily pressures. Maybe you're wondering why change efforts fail even when the analysis is solid and the intentions are good.</p>

                    <p>Here's what I've learned: most change efforts treat organizations like machines to be fixed rather than living systems to be tended. They match solutions to problems rather than meeting what's actually alive in the situation.</p>

                    <h3>The Matching Trap</h3>

                    <p>Matching means arriving with your framework and trying to fit the situation to it. I do this all the time - I catch myself thinking "oh, this is a strategic alignment problem" or "this needs Open Space" before I've really listened to what's happening. It's easier to apply what you already know than to stay curious about what you don't yet understand.</p>

                    <p>A consultant who always recommends the same strategic planning process regardless of culture. Standard conflict resolution protocols implemented without understanding relationship history. "Best practices" imported from one context into another as if context doesn't matter. I've done all of these.</p>

                    <h3>What Meeting Looks Like</h3>

                    <p>Meeting means I have to slow down enough to actually listen. To be curious about how this particular situation came to be. What's the history here? What unspoken agreements hold the current structure in place? What's the organizational immune system protecting, and why?</p>

                    <p>Last month I was working with a team that kept having the same conflict resurface. My first instinct was to suggest a decision-making protocol I know works well. But when I actually listened, I heard that their conflict wasn't about decision-making at all - it was about trust broken years ago that nobody had ever named. No protocol was going to address that. We needed to create space for something harder: acknowledging what had happened and feeling through whether they wanted to repair it.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes meeting means discovering the intervention you prepared isn't the intervention that's needed. That's uncomfortable when you've been hired as the expert.</p>

                    <h3>What We Actually Offer</h3>

                    <p>Through CrowdWork cooperative (which I started with Justin and Denia), we work with organizations using methodologies designed for emergence rather than control. Open Space Technology for strategic planning that honors what wants to happen rather than forcing predetermined direction. Art of Hosting for developing the capacity to hold space across difference and conflict. Circle processes for decision-making that serves the whole rather than just the loudest voices.</p>

                    <p>But here's what we're actually trying to do: build your capacity to do this yourselves. We facilitate while teaching your team these approaches. Not because we're altruistic, but because dependency doesn't serve anyone. We're trying to work ourselves out of a job with each engagement.</p>

                    <p>Does it always work? No. Sometimes we get called in when it's already too late - when trust is so broken that no process can repair it, when economic pressures demand speed over depth, when leadership wants transformation without being willing to transform themselves. We're still learning when to say yes and when to say "we're not the right fit for this."</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>The Interior Condition Question</h4>
                        <p>Before asking what methodology to use, we ask: what's your interior condition as you approach this? Are you trying to fix something you see as broken, or tend to something you recognize as alive? Are you certain about what needs to happen, or genuinely curious about what wants to emerge? These questions matter more than technique. And they're harder to answer honestly than you might think.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I still don't have this figured out. I still catch myself matching instead of meeting, applying frameworks instead of staying curious, trying to control outcomes instead of tending conditions. But at least now I notice when I'm doing it. That noticing - that's where the real work begins.</p>

                    <p>Dear Friend,</p>

                    <p>You might be reading this from an office, a hospital, a university, a nonprofit, anywhere institutional life happens. Maybe you're good at your work. Maybe you're even successful by conventional measures. But there's something you sense that's hard to name - a way you could show up that you're not currently showing up.</p>

                    <p>Everyone wants to talk about burnout, toxic management, work-life balance. Those are real issues. But I (BK) don't think they're what you're actually sensing. I think you're picking up on something more fundamental - a misalignment between who you're capable of being and who the institution allows you to be.</p>

                    <p>Here's what I've learned: <strong>You are not your job, but you absolutely are how you do your job.</strong></p>

                    <p>Your work is a performance, in the deepest sense. Not fake performance - authentic performance. Like a musician who practices the same scales for years, developing the capacity to meet each moment with everything they have. You have many stages - not just your workplace, but your family, your community, your inner life. And on each stage, you're practicing how to be present, how to relate, how to sense what matters.</p>

                    <h3>The Developmental Lens</h3>

                    <p>What if your current position isn't a trap but a dojo? A place to develop the capacity to observe yourself within systems, to notice the systems you're living within, to sense the relationships that inform those systems, to watch how your identity shifts across contexts?</p>

                    <p>Here's what makes this tricky: the same patterns appear whether you're looking at yourself, your team, your organization, your community, your industry, or society itself. The dynamics are fractal - which means you can practice at any scale. You don't need to be a CEO to develop these capacities. You just need to actually pay attention.</p>

                    <p>I'm still learning this. Last week in a team meeting, I watched myself get defensive about feedback. Really watched it - not just experienced the defensiveness, but observed how it arose, what narrative it was protecting, how it affected the relational field in the room. That observation didn't make the defensiveness go away. But it created just enough space to respond differently than I usually do.</p>

                    <p>That space between stimulus and response - that's what practice cultivates. Not being perfect, but being increasingly able to meet what's actually here rather than reacting from habit.</p>

                    <h3>Building Bridges</h3>

                    <p>Our work (CX and I collaborate on this) is really about helping people build bridges. Bridges within yourself - between who you are professionally and who you are in other contexts, between your ideals and your actual behavior, between your frustration with systems and your complicity in maintaining them. And bridges to each other - across difference, across conflict, across the isolation that institutional life tends to create.</p>

                    <p>Most importantly, bridges that help you sense which relationships actually make a difference. Not all relationships are equal. Some are transactional and that's fine. But some relationships - if you tend them - become spaces where genuine transformation is possible. Learning to sense that difference matters more than any technique.</p>

                    <p>The challenge isn't fixing your workplace or escaping it. The challenge is developing the capacity to meet whatever situation you're in with more presence, more awareness, more ability to sense and respond to what's actually needed.</p>

                    <h3>Practical Pathways</h3>

                    <p>So what does this actually look like? We're experimenting with different approaches, and honestly, some work better than others. Here's what exists right now:</p>

                    <p>Our monthly community calls are free - we use Art of Hosting practices to create space for actual dialogue rather than just people taking turns talking. Sometimes they're profound, sometimes they're awkward, always they're real. You can join just to listen if you want. We also have an open-source toolkit of protocols and frameworks that people can use and adapt.</p>

                    <p>The dojos - CommDojo for communication practice, Conflict Kinship Dojo for navigating conflict, Facilitation Craft Dojo for learning to hold space - these are monthly gatherings where we actually practice specific capacities. Not just learning about them, but practicing them with real situations. They use gift economy principles, which means you pay what you can and nobody's turned away for lack of funds.</p>

                    <p>The guilds are more intensive - 8-12 weeks focused on specific areas like working with organizational immune systems or exploring sustainable livelihood models. These cost $75-150/month, but again, extensive scholarships and work-trade options exist. We're trying to make this accessible while also keeping it sustainable enough that the people holding these spaces don't burn out.</p>

                    <p>We have longer topic labs - currently focused on Alternatives to Extractive Models (ATEM) - bringing together diverse stakeholders for 6-month explorations of complex challenges. These help you develop the capacity to see patterns across different domains, to think systemically, to work with civilizational-scale issues.</p>

                    <p>And through CrowdWork cooperative, we do organizational facilitation - though that requires either having influence in your organization or budget authority.</p>

                    <p>None of these are magic solutions. They're all just different contexts for practicing the same fundamental capacities: presence, awareness, relationship, sensing what matters.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Start</h3>

                    <p>You don't need to figure this all out at once. Join a community call. Practice bringing slightly more presence to your current work, whatever it is. Download some protocols and try them. Find a few people who share your questions - that matters more than any specific methodology.</p>

                    <p>Notice when you're matching (applying what you already know) versus meeting (staying curious about what's actually here). Notice when you're performing your professional role versus bringing your whole self. Notice the difference between relationships that feel transactional and relationships that feel alive. Just notice. That's the practice.</p>

                    <p>The development of your capacity to observe, to be present, to navigate complexity - this matters more than your title or your organization's transformation. Because you take these capacities with you wherever you go. They're the actual work, regardless of what your job description says.</p>

                    <p>I'm still practicing this myself. I don't have it figured out. But I know it's more honest than pretending the only options are to either accept things as they are or escape to something better. There's a third way: developing your capacity to meet what's here, fully, with everything you've got.</p>

                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>

                    <p>You know the tension: how to create sustainable livelihood while serving transformation. How to integrate spiritual practice with practical effectiveness. How to avoid either selling out to systems that don't serve life or burning out trying to create change without adequate resources.</p>

                    <p>I (CX) want to be honest about what we've learned, including what we're still figuring out.</p>

                    <h3>What Failed and Why</h3>

                    <p>When BK and I started The Present of Work 1.0, along with Starter Cultures and other partners, we had what felt like evolved understanding. We'd learned from earlier failures. We knew about emergence, about working with rather than against organizational dynamics, about the importance of relationships.</p>

                    <p>We worked with tech companies, nonprofits, the government of New Zealand. People valued what we offered. But we still hadn't solved the fundamental challenge: how do you create livelihood contexts where people can feel secure enough to show up fully? Where they're genuinely held in relationship rather than just compensated for time?</p>

                    <p>We lost key people not because they stopped believing in the work, but because they couldn't sustain themselves doing it. And here's what hurts: we saw it happening and didn't know how to address it without reverting to the very extractive models we were trying to transform.</p>

                    <p>One person left for a corporate job that paid three times what we could offer. Another took a faculty position because they needed health insurance. A third just quietly stopped showing up to meetings because the gap between vision and material reality had become unbearable. Each loss diminished not just our capacity but our coherence as a community.</p>

                    <p>What we learned: <strong>you cannot separate the spiritual, intellectual, and relational dimensions of work from the economic dimension without undermining the whole.</strong> Transformation work must be grounded in right relationship with material reality, not just with ideas and intentions.</p>

                    <h3>The Current Experiment</h3>

                    <p>Now we organize through a hybrid model. Educational work is fiscally sponsored through Inquiring Systems Institute, operating on gift economy principles. Consulting services run through CrowdWork cooperative (which BK started with Justin and Denia). This separation allows us to maintain both accessibility and sustainability.</p>

                    <p>Does it work perfectly? No. There's still tension between the gift economy principle that nobody should be turned away for lack of funds and the reality that people need to pay rent. We offer extensive scholarships and work-trade options, which means those with more financial capacity subsidize those with less. This works until it doesn't - until the people with capacity get tired of carrying more weight, or until we realize we're still not reaching people facing serious economic constraints.</p>

                    <p>We're experimenting with dhana practice (gift economy following Buddhist dana tradition) for the dojos, sliding scale for the guilds ($75-150/month), and standard pricing for deeper work like the topic labs ($200 for a 6-month cycle). But I'm not sure we've cracked the code on how to make this actually sustainable rather than dependent on a few people's generosity.</p>

                    <h3>Methodologies That Help</h3>

                    <p>Rather than inventing new techniques, we've found power in applying time-tested protocols: Open Space Technology for meetings where passion guides emergence. Art of Hosting for developing capacity to hold space across difference. Circle processes and council from indigenous traditions for decision-making. Warm data labs (Nora Bateson's methodology) for understanding complex relationships. Transcontextual inquiry for recognizing patterns across domains.</p>

                    <p>These work not because they're magic, but because they've been refined through decades or centuries of practice. They help people access capacities they already have but haven't developed. They create conditions for emergence rather than trying to engineer outcomes.</p>

                    <p>But here's what I'm still learning: knowing these methodologies doesn't automatically mean I know when to use them or how to adapt them to different contexts. Sometimes I get attached to a particular approach and try to force it to fit. Sometimes I'm so afraid of matching (imposing predetermined solutions) that I fail to offer structure when structure is actually what's needed.</p>

                    <h3>The Three-Layer Ecosystem</h3>

                    <p>We talk about Soil/Commons, Knots, and Social Web as three layers of our ecosystem. The Soil layer is free - community calls, open-source resources, peer learning. The Knots layer is the dojos and guilds where deeper practice happens. The Social Web is consulting and facilitation work.</p>

                    <p>In theory, this functions like a healthy forest where resources flow naturally, creating abundance rather than scarcity. Each layer draws from and contributes back to the commons, following Elinor Ostrom's principles for managing shared resources.</p>

                    <p>In practice? Sometimes it works beautifully. Someone joins a free community call, gets curious, participates in a dojo, develops capacity, eventually offers facilitation that contributes resources back to the commons. The gift keeps moving.</p>

                    <p>Other times, the flow gets stuck. People extract value from the commons without contributing back. Or we realize someone needs support we can't provide within our current structure. Or the people holding the spaces get depleted because the reciprocity isn't actually balanced.</p>

                    <p>We're trying to be honest about these limitations rather than pretending we've solved something we haven't.</p>

                    <h3>What We're Still Figuring Out</h3>

                    <p>How do we address the needs of people with significant financial obligations - mortgages, student loans, supporting families - who can't participate in gift economy experiments? Our current approaches work well for people with financial flexibility, but that's a privileged subset.</p>

                    <p>How do we build cultural bridges to people from different backgrounds? Right now, our ecosystem attracts people already aligned with regenerative values, already familiar with this language. We're missing pathways for engaging people who haven't encountered these frameworks before.</p>

                    <p>How do we scale without losing soul? How do we maintain depth and quality of relationship as networks grow? How do we avoid recreating the very dynamics we're trying to transform - where a few people end up carrying most of the weight?</p>

                    <p>I don't have answers to these questions. I'm suspicious of practitioners who claim they do. What I have is ongoing experiment, continuing failure, occasional breakthrough, and commitment to learning from all of it.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Our ATEM Work</h4>
                        <p>Through our Alternatives to Extractive Models work, we're bringing together people from different parts of systems - including philanthropy, economics, and community organizing - to explore these questions together. Not to create another framework, but to learn from each other's experiments and failures. To map the territory we're all trying to navigate.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>If you're doing similar work, I'd welcome connection. Not to compare best practices or pitch what we offer, but to learn from your experiments. To share honestly about what's working and what isn't. To be in solidarity with the difficulty of this work.</p>

                    <p>Because here's what I'm certain of: transformation happens through relationship, and relationship requires material conditions that allow people to show up fully. We haven't figured out how to create those conditions consistently. But we're committed to continuing the experiment, to being honest about failures, to learning in community rather than trying to solve this alone.</p>

                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>Dear Resource Stewards,</p>

                    <p>I (BK) want to start with an uncomfortable truth: I don't know how to talk to funders without our dynamic immediately recreating the very power imbalances we're trying to transform.</p>

                    <p>You've likely experienced the limitations of traditional philanthropic models. The way power dynamics persist even in "trust-based" approaches. How impact metrics reduce complex social change to simplistic measures. How the very structure of having "funders" and "recipients" reinforces extraction rather than transforming it.</p>

                    <p>Maybe you've tried different frameworks - trust-based philanthropy, participatory grantmaking, effective altruism. Each has insights. Each also has blind spots it can't see from within its own assumptions.</p>

                    <h3>What We're Actually Exploring</h3>

                    <p>Our current focus through Alternatives to Extractive Models (ATEM) is bringing together diverse stakeholders from the philanthropy ecosystem - not just funders, but recipients, intermediaries, critics - to explore what becomes possible when we examine our assumptions about how resources should flow.</p>

                    <p>This isn't another philanthropic framework. It's not a pitch for funding our work. It's an invitation to genuine inquiry into what alternatives might exist.</p>

                    <div class="quote-box">
                        <p>"A gift is not a gift until it moves. When we give it away, we ourselves come to receive the mysterious energy of the gift. A gift must always move."</p>
                        <p class="quote-author">- Lewis Hyde</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>In healthy gift economies, giving creates and maintains relationships rather than ending them. The gift keeps circulating. Compare this with typical grant cycles: funding is released, work is done, reports are submitted, the relationship ends. Or worse, continues only through the artificial maintenance of reporting requirements and funding applications.</p>

                    <p>What if there were different possibilities?</p>

                    <h3>What We're Learning</h3>

                    <p>Relationship-first funding would mean long-term partnerships based on shared values rather than project-specific grants. But what does this actually look like when you're accountable to a board or donor base that wants measurable outcomes?</p>

                    <p>Reciprocal learning would mean funders as learning partners transformed by the work they support, not just observers measuring from outside. But how do you maintain appropriate boundaries while being genuinely transformed by relationship?</p>

                    <p>Commons building would mean investments creating shared resources rather than organizational dependencies. But how do you fund commons development when most philanthropic structures are designed around discrete projects with clear deliverables?</p>

                    <p>I'm asking these as genuine questions, not rhetorical ones. We don't have the answers. We're experimenting, failing, learning, trying again.</p>

                    <h3>The Tension We're Living</h3>

                    <p>Here's our current dilemma: We need resources to sustain the work. People need to eat, pay rent, support families. We can't run entirely on volunteer labor without burning people out or only engaging those with independent wealth.</p>

                    <p>But we also can't just accept traditional funding relationships without recreating the dynamics we're trying to transform. The moment we write a grant proposal with predetermined outcomes, we've already compromised the emergence we're trying to serve. The moment we accept funding contingent on specific metrics, we've imported extractive logic into the work itself.</p>

                    <p>So we're trying to hold both: the material need for resources and the spiritual/relational need to transform how those resources flow. It's uncomfortable. Sometimes it feels impossible.</p>

                    <h3>The ATEM Lab Experiment</h3>

                    <p>Our 6-month Reimagining Philanthropy lab brings together 12-15 people from across the philanthropy ecosystem. We use warm data methodology - not to solve problems, but to understand the complex relational patterns that create current dynamics.</p>

                    <p>This is risky. What if we spend six months and don't produce any actionable frameworks? What if the learning is valuable but doesn't translate into fundable programs? What if the transformation needed is deeper than any individual or organization can address?</p>

                    <p>These are real concerns. But we're doing it anyway, because the alternative - continuing patterns that everyone agrees are problematic - seems worse.</p>

                    <h3>An Invitation Without Agenda</h3>

                    <p>If you're interested in exploring alternatives to extractive models in your own resource stewardship, we'd welcome conversation. Not conversation as prelude to funding proposal. Genuine conversation about what we're all learning, what confuses us, what we're trying that's failing, what's working in unexpected ways.</p>

                    <p>Maybe you'd be interested in participating in our Reimagining Philanthropy lab. Maybe you'd want to support others' participation. Maybe you just want to stay connected as we share what we're learning. Maybe none of this resonates and that's okay too.</p>

                    <p>The invitation is to relationship first, with resource flow emerging from authentic partnership rather than predetermined transaction. I don't know if this is naive or necessary. Probably both.</p>

                    <p>What I do know: the current system isn't working for anyone. Not for funders frustrated by lack of transformative results. Not for recipients exhausted by reporting requirements and donor management. Not for communities who need resources but get programs designed by people far removed from lived reality.</p>

                    <p>Maybe together we can find something better. Or maybe we'll fail in ways that teach us what we need to know next. Either way, it seems worth the attempt.</p>

                    <p>Dear Fellow Learners,</p>

                    <p>We (BK and CX) want to share our story not as success narrative but as learning journey marked by breakthrough insights and painful failures. If you're looking for a clean arc from problem to solution, this isn't it. What we have is messier and maybe more useful: what we've tried, what failed, what we're still figuring out.</p>

                    <h3>The Corporate Innovation Experiment (BK)</h3>

                    <p>I already mentioned the corporate change initiative in my letter to leaders, but there's more to that story. What I didn't say: for months after it fell apart, I couldn't talk about it without getting angry. I'd built my identity around being someone who could navigate institutional dynamics, who understood emergence, who knew how to build coalitions.</p>

                    <p>The failure felt personal because I'd thought I was different. I'd thought my approach was evolved enough to succeed where others failed. The organization's immune system taught me otherwise.</p>

                    <p>But here's what's strange: years later, I stay in touch with several people from that team. The relationships outlasted the initiative. Some of those people are now doing interesting work in other contexts, applying what we learned together. So maybe it wasn't total failure? Or maybe I'm just making peace with something that still stings.</p>

                    <h3>SolvrX: Learning to Stop Generating (BK)</h3>

                    <p>After leaving corporate life, I started SolvrX as innovation consultancy. We had cutting-edge approaches, strong branding, good early traction. But we couldn't stand out in a crowded marketplace, and more fundamentally, I realized we were still generating activity instead of flowing with what was already moving.</p>

                    <p>Success metrics that ignore relationship and meaning lead to meaningless success. I knew this intellectually. Living it was different. I remember the morning I admitted to myself that I'd created something I didn't actually want to continue building. That admission hurt. But it opened space for something else.</p>

                    <h3>CrowdWork: Learning Through Cooperation (BK with Justin and Denia)</h3>

                    <p>SolvrX's failure taught me about the centrality of relationship in all change work. This led Justin, Denia, and me to start CrowdWork as a worker cooperative. Different organizational structure, different values embedded in how we made decisions and shared resources.</p>

                    <p>CrowdWork continues today. It works because the structure embodies what we're trying to practice. But it's not perfect. We still struggle with how to make decisions efficiently while maintaining true democracy. We still have tensions about who carries more weight. We're still learning how to be a cooperative rather than just saying we are one.</p>

                    <p>What I learned: organizational form matters. Cooperative structures can embody values that hierarchical structures make nearly impossible to maintain. But structure alone doesn't solve everything. We still have to learn how to actually practice cooperation, which turns out to be harder than adopting cooperative bylaws.</p>

                    <h3>TPOW 1.0: The Material Wisdom We Missed (CX with BK and others)</h3>

                    <p>Using lessons from CrowdWork, BK and I launched The Present of Work 1.0 along with Starter Cultures and other partners. We worked with tech companies, nonprofits, the government of New Zealand. People valued what we offered. We were doing meaningful work.</p>

                    <p>But we discovered we had missed the material wisdom. Despite our evolved understanding of emergence, we hadn't solved how to create livelihood contexts where people could feel secure. The absence of sustainable income led to loss of key people and vision.</p>

                    <p>I remember the conversation where someone I deeply respected told me they were leaving. They still believed in the work. They just couldn't keep doing it without stable income. What could I say? I didn't have a solution to offer. Still don't, not fully.</p>

                    <p>What we learned: you cannot separate the spiritual, intellectual, and relational dimensions of work from the economic dimension without undermining the whole. This seems obvious in hindsight. It wasn't obvious when we were living it.</p>

                    <h3>TPOW 2.0: Current Experiment (CX and BK)</h3>

                    <p>This recognition led us to our current iteration - a hybrid model separating educational work (fiscally sponsored through Inquiring Systems Institute) from consulting services (through CrowdWork cooperative). We operate on gift economy principles while maintaining practical sustainability.</p>

                    <p>Does it work? Sometimes. We've created space for people to participate regardless of financial capacity. We've maintained quality of relationship alongside material sustainability. We've demonstrated that alternatives are possible.</p>

                    <p>But we haven't solved the fundamental tension. Gift economy works for some people in some contexts. It doesn't work for everyone. We're still trying to figure out how to bridge between ideal and material reality without compromising either.</p>

                    <h3>What We're Still Struggling With</h3>

                    <p>Last month we had a team conversation about someone who wanted to participate in a guild but couldn't afford even our lowest sliding scale rate. One person argued we should just let them in for free. Another pointed out that if we do that for everyone who asks, the people paying are subsidizing everyone else and eventually they'll get tired of it. Someone else suggested work-trade, but we don't actually have work that person's skills match.</p>

                    <p>We didn't resolve it. We made a decision for that particular case, but the underlying question remains: how do we actually practice gift economy in a context where most people still need money to survive?</p>

                    <p>Economic realism gap: Our approaches work well for people with financial flexibility. We haven't adequately addressed needs of people with significant financial obligations - mortgages, student loans, supporting families, dealing with health issues that require income stability.</p>

                    <p>Cultural bridge building: Our ecosystem currently attracts people already aligned with regenerative values, already familiar with this language. We're missing pathways for engaging people from different backgrounds who haven't encountered these frameworks before. Are we actually creating alternatives or just creating comfortable spaces for people who already think like us?</p>

                    <p>Scaling without losing soul: How do we maintain depth and quality of relationship as our network grows? We've seen what happens when networks get too big - they fragment or bureaucratize or lose the relational depth that made them valuable. We don't know how to prevent this. We're trying to learn from other networks' experiments, but each context is different.</p>

                    <h3>The Pattern That Connects</h3>

                    <p>Looking back through all these experiments - corporate innovation, consulting, cooperative, TPOW 1.0 and 2.0 - I (BK) see a pattern emerging: <strong>transformation happens through relationship, and relationship requires material conditions that allow people to show up fully.</strong></p>

                    <p>This includes economic relationships - how resources flow, who has security, who carries risk. It includes power relationships - who makes decisions, whose voice matters, what happens when there's conflict. And it includes our relationship with the material conditions that support life and work - the reality that people need food, shelter, healthcare, community.</p>

                    <p>We keep trying to separate these dimensions. To focus on the spiritual while ignoring the material. To change power dynamics while leaving economic structures untouched. To create beautiful visions while neglecting practical sustainability. Every time we do this, we fail in similar ways.</p>

                    <p>The integration required is harder than we thought. We're still learning how to practice it.</p>

                    <h3>What This Means for You</h3>

                    <p>If you're considering engaging with our work, we want you to know what you're actually getting into. Not a perfected system or proven methodology. An ongoing experiment by people who've failed multiple times and are still learning from those failures.</p>

                    <p>We believe in building bridges - between people, within yourself, across different ways of understanding work and life. We believe relationship matters more than technique. We believe transformation requires holding both spiritual and material dimensions without collapsing one into the other.</p>

                    <p>But we haven't figured out how to do this consistently. We're building the bridge while walking on it. Sometimes the bridge holds. Sometimes we have to rebuild sections. Sometimes we're not sure if we're making progress or just moving sideways.</p>

                    <p>If that sounds frustrating, it is. If it also sounds honest and maybe even necessary, then perhaps we're working on similar questions. We'd welcome you in that exploration, not as people who have answers but as fellow travelers trying to figure this out together.</p>
