    <!-- Origins -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Our Origins</h2>
        
        <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f0fdf4 0%, #dcfce7 100%); border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; border-radius: 8px; padding: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">
            <p><strong>The Present of Work is a learning network exploring how we can transform our relationship with work itself - moving from "Work" (industrial jobs focused on productivity and profit) to "work" (sacred practice that serves life and deepens our connection to community and the living world).</strong></p>
            
            <p>Founded by practitioners who experienced firsthand the disconnection between conventional work structures and human flourishing, we started as a small group exploring what regenerative work relationships might look like. Drawing from indigenous wisdom traditions like the Quechua understanding of <em>llankay</em> (work integrated with love and wisdom), Buddhist concepts of right livelihood, and proven methodologies like Open Space Technology and Art of Hosting.</p>
            
            <p>Like fermentation cultures that break down what was into something new and nourishing, our work creates conditions for the transformation of work itself. What began as intimate conversations about meaning and purpose has evolved into a living commons—a shared space where we're building platforms of relationships and weaving networks of meaning that enable people to live lives of purpose and contribution.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Our Three-Layer Learning Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>We organize learning through three interconnected layers that function like living systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soil/Commons:</strong> Free resources, community calls, and open-source wisdom that feeds all our work</li>
            <li><strong>Knots:</strong> Skill-building dojos and guilds where people develop capacities while tending relationships</li>
            <li><strong>Social Web:</strong> Deep dive explorations and organizational support that translates individual learning into collective impact</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Our network operates on gift economy principles while maintaining sustainability through a hybrid model that separates educational work (fiscally sponsored through Inquiring Systems Institute) from consulting services (through our CrowdWork cooperative).</p>

        <h2>Current Focus: Alternatives to Extractive Models (ATEM)</h2>
        
        <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef7ff 0%, #f3e8ff 100%); border-left: 4px solid #9333ea; border-radius: 8px; padding: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">
            <h4 style="color: #7c3aed; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px;">Reimagining Philanthropy Lab - Starting 2025</h4>
            <p style="color: #6b21a8; margin-bottom: 8px;">Our first Alternatives to Extractive Models (ATEM) cohort focuses on reimagining philanthropy beyond the usual frameworks of trust-based philanthropy, impact philanthropy, or effective altruism. We're bringing together stakeholders from the philanthropy world - funders, recipients, intermediaries, and critics - to explore how we can transform our relationship from extractive and transactional ways of navigating the world.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #6b21a8; margin-bottom: 8px;">Using our soil, web, and knotting practices, we'll help participants think differently about wealth, power, relationship, and reciprocity. This isn't about tweaking existing models - it's about exploring what becomes possible when we approach philanthropy as gift economy, as relational tending, as participation in the web of life.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #6b21a8;"><strong>Applications open:</strong> Contact us if you're involved in philanthropy and want to explore alternatives to extractive methods.</p>
        </div>

        <p>ATEM represents our exploration of alternatives to extractive methods across all domains - from money and resources to relationships and knowledge. The core question: How do we shift from taking from the world to participating in the ongoing creation of the world?</p>

    <!-- Vision -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What We're Working Toward</h2>
        
        <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #dbeafe 0%, #bfdbfe 100%); border: 2px solid #3b82f6; border-radius: 12px; padding: 24px; margin: 24px 0;">
            <h3 style="color: #1d4ed8; margin-bottom: 16px;">Our Vision</h3>
            <p style="color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 12px;">We envision communities of practice sprouting everywhere—"The Present of Education," "The Present of Healthcare," "The Present of Technology"—each applying these frameworks to their domain while contributing insights back to the broader ecosystem. We see new organizational forms emerging that operate from principles of wholeness, regeneration, and shared prosperity.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #1e40af; margin-bottom: 12px;">This isn't about replacing existing systems overnight, but creating parallel structures and demonstrating what becomes possible when we organize around our full humanity.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Three Meanings of "Present"</h3>
        <p>When we speak of the "present of work," we invoke three profound dimensions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Present as Presence:</strong> Full engagement with what is actually here, bringing complete attention to whatever we're tending</li>
            <li><strong>Present as Present Moment:</strong> Work rooted in this moment rather than anxious projection into future outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Present as Gift:</strong> Work as offering that strengthens rather than depletes the web of life through relational tending</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Core Principles -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <p>These aren't just nice ideas—they're our core beliefs that actively guide how we make decisions, design gatherings, approach projects, and relate to each other.</p>

        <div style="display: grid; gap: 24px; margin: 32px 0;">
            <div style="border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #16a34a; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f0fdf4 0%, #dcfce7 100%);">
                <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #15803d;">Meeting Not Matching</h4>
                <p>We practice deep listening and curiosity about how situations came to be, responding to what's actually present rather than imposing predetermined solutions.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #2563eb; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #eff6ff 0%, #dbeafe 100%);">
                <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #1d4ed8;">Gift-Based Economics</h4>
                <p>We design economic relationships that honor both offering authentic gifts and receiving material support, creating relational tending through how resources flow.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #d97706; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fefbeb 0%, #fef3c7 100%);">
                <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #b45309;">Transcontextual Learning</h4>
                <p>We recognize that patterns operating in one domain can inform organizing in another. Insights from nature inform business, wisdom from indigenous cultures illuminates technology design.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #9333ea; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fdf4ff 0%, #fae8ff 100%);">
                <h4 style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px; color: #7c3aed;">Emergence Over Engineering</h4>
                <p>Like gardener-conveners rather than mechanical engineers, we create conditions for what wants to emerge rather than trying to control outcomes.</p>

    <!-- What We're Still Learning -->
    <div class="section">
        <h2>What We're Still Learning</h2>
        <p>We're not perfect, and we want to be honest about our limitations:</p>

        <div style="background: #fef2f2; border: 2px solid #fca5a5; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h4 style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px;">Economic Realism Gap</h4>
            <p style="color: #991b1b; margin-bottom: 8px;">Our approaches work well for people with some financial flexibility, but we haven't adequately addressed the needs of people with significant financial obligations—mortgages, student loans, medical debt, family support responsibilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background: #fef2f2; border: 2px solid #fca5a5; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h4 style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px;">Cultural Bridge Building</h4>
            <p style="color: #991b1b; margin-bottom: 8px;">Our ecosystem currently attracts people already somewhat aligned with regenerative values. We're missing pathways for engaging people from conservative backgrounds, traditional business environments, or those skeptical of alternative economic models.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="background: #fef2f2; border: 2px solid #fca5a5; border-radius: 8px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <h4 style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 12px;">Scaling Without Losing Soul</h4>
            <p style="color: #991b1b; margin-bottom: 8px;">How do we maintain depth and quality as our network grows? We're still developing robust ways to measure success and address situations where our approaches cause unintended harm.</p>
